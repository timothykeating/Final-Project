# Final-Project

# The economic impact of COVID across people in different demographic groups and education levels.


## Introduction

COVID has had an huge impact on the economy and our lives. The impact of COVID has not been uniform across different groups. By conducting this study, we hope to examine how COVID has affected individuals in terms of their employment situation. Findings from this study could help policy makers in creating appropriate support structures for affected individuals. For this study, we have narrowed our focus to North Carolina. 

## Data Source
