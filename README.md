# Final-Project
## CoronaVirus Omicron Variant Forecast

## Introduction
Chris, Timothy and Vedika are teaming up on this final project that will look into historical data related to the Alpha and Delta variants of the CoronaVirus.  We will eventually attempt to employ Supervised Machine Learning to forecast future developments of the Omicron variant that is curently spreading worldwide.  The ability to forecast the numbers of Omicron would be of huge significance.

We have found a source dataset that shows data about all known CoronaVirus variants, broken down by Country on a daily basis since May 2020.  We have also pulled in source data specific to the countries that we are interested in: <list of countries here>.

We will use these data to show the historical progression of the CoronaVirus graphically, as we curate the data to prepare it for use in our Machine Learning Model.  

### Communication Protocols
This group will meet during class time on Tuesdays and Thursday; as well as on Mondays and Wednesdays at 7pm on Zoom.  Group members are in contact via email, mobile phone and Slack.
Team members have their GitHubs set up with each team member owning a branch off of 'main'.
